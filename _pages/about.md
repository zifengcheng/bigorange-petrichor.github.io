I received my B.E. degree from Qingdao University, China in June 2018.
In the same year, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree in Nanjing University under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://isetnju.github.io/guq/index.html" target="_black">Qing Gu</a>.
Currently, I am working with Prof. <a href="https://isetnju.github.io/guq/index.html" target="_black">Qing Gu</a> and Assistant Professor <a href="https://zhiweinju.github.io/" target="_black"> Zhiwei Jiang</a> for a Ph.D. degree.
  
Main Research Interests
======

I have a broad interest in large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP). Currently, I am primarily focusing on the following aspects:
* Test-time or training-free algorithm for LLMs

* Attack and Defense of LLMs

* Downstream task adaptation of LLMs, including parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and few-shot or zero-shot learning on NLP tasks

* Hallucinations of LLMs

* Intervention and Editing Techniques for LLMs
<!--My prior research experience included both emotion-cause pair extraction, open intent classification, multi-label text classification, essay scoring, and so on.-->
